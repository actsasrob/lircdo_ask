          "description":"Baba Zoo is a 'voice first' interface for controlling your home audio/video equipment using infrared (IR) signals. There are two components:\n\n  1. Baba Zoo Alexa Skill\n  2. Baba Zoo server/service\n\nThe Baba Zoo Alexa Skill is responsible for responding to your voice commands via an Alexa-enabled device. The Alexa service processes your requests, determines the actions you would like to perform, invokes the appropriate handler within the Baba Zoo Alexa skill, and passes along the action to perform and any extra arguments. The Baba Zoo skill validates the input then communicates with the Baba Zoo server/service in your home.\n\nThe Baba Zoo server/service component is implemented using a small computer(e.g. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B) residing in your home and running the Baba Zoo service. The Baba Zoo server refers to the physical hardware. The Baba Zoo service refers to the software running on the server. The Baba Zoo server requires additional hardware capable of emitting IR signals. The Baba Zoo server/IR emitter combination control your home audio/video (AV) equipment using IR signals.    **YOU MUST BUILD THIS COMPONENT YOURSELF!!!**.\n\nThe Baba Zoo server/service receives commands from the Baba Zoo Alexa skill and matches the commands to scripts residing on the Baba Zoo server. If a match is found the script is executed. The scripts, that you create, use LIRC (see http://www.lirc.org/ for more info) to generate and send IR signals to control your home audio/video equipment.\n\nTo get started and learn more please navigate to this link in a browser: https://github.com/actsasrob/lircdo_ask/blob/master/README.md\n\n",
