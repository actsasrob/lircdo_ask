main state state handler Help intent should give the user some sample actions to perform.

Handle state base one userId and deviceId basis. This would allow user's to pair a different lircdo server for each Alexa device.

deviceList = [ { deviceId: this.event.context.System.device.deviceId, fqdn: "fqdn1", port: "port1", shared_secret: "ss1" }, { deviceId: "device2", fqdn: "fqdn2"} ];
                       speechOutput = 'The server-side LIRC Do application has been paired successfully. You should now restart the server-side LIRC Do application in non-pairing mode.';
                       this.attributes['applicationFQDN'] = json_response.fqdn;
                       this.attributes['applicationPort'] = json_response.port;
                       this.attributes['shared_secret'] = json_response.shared_secret;
                       this.attributes['deviceList'] = deviceList;
