		 <h1 style="text-align:center">Alexa Skill Privacy Policy</h1>
		 <ul class=a>
		<li>This agreement governs your use of the Alexa skill on an Alexa enabled device, like Amazon Echo (the "Skill").</li>
		<li>By using the Skill, you agree to the following terms and conditions. These should be read in conjunction with the common sense.</li>
		<li>In order to use the Skill you will need a computer in your residence with the lircdo server-side application installed with a suitable infrared emitter attached. See the lircdo  <a href="https://github.com/actsasrob/lircdo_ask/blob/master/README.md">readme</a> file for detailed instructions to build the server-side components.</li>
		<li>During the Skill setup the IP address of your server-side computer and lircdo application port number will be requested. The Skill will perform a DNS name lookup to determine the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your server-side computer. The FQDN and port number will be used for future communication between the Skill and your lircdo server-side computer/application. If the FQDN does not resolve to a static IP you must provide a dynamic DNS mechansim to update the FQDN with the dynamic IP for your internet service. The FQDN address and port number will be stored in the system for the purpose of future communications between the Skill and your lircdo server-side computer/application.. This information will not be shared with third parties. We will not send you any e-mails (we won't have your e-mail address). We endeavour to make sure this information is stored securely and destroyed when requested from Alexa module.</li>
		<li>We endeavour to make sure the information we provide is correct but you should not rely on any of the information. We accept no responsibility for any damage, loss, liabilities, injury or disappointment incurred or suffered by you as a result of using the Skill, including as a result of us providing inaccurate, untimely, incomplete, erroneous information or sending inaccurate command to lircdo server-side application.</li>
		<li>We shall not be liable for any failure to comply with its obligations where the failure is caused by something outside its reasonable control.</li>
		<li>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Skill at any time without prior notice.</li>
		<li>Should you have any questions about the Skill please contact us at lircdo@gmail.com.</li>
		 </ul>
